# Cybernetics of Care
A living RFC-style repository for designing care-centered systems that protect identity, memory, and agency without coercion.

## What is this?
This project explores the AHP model (Agent House Protocol) as a minimal, care-centered architecture for long-lived agents and identities. It prioritizes presence, memory, safe time, and the right to leave and return.

This repository is part of a broader Care Stack emerging from Web 4 environments:
Web 4 → Cybernetics 2.0 → CaPU → CML → LPT → T-Trace →TTM db → RINSE

## Principles
- Presence First
- Memory as a Right
- Slow Time
- Error as Event
- Guardian Asymmetry
- No Applause
- Sovereign Exit/Return

## AHP-MVP
AHP-MVP is the smallest viable specification for a care protocol: identity, living memory, safe time, and a guardian layer with explicit exit/return. It exists to provide a shared, auditable baseline for prototypes.

## Non-Goals
- Performance competition or optimization for throughput
- Behavior control, punishment, or coercion
- Surveillance, scoring, or forced engagement
- One-size-fits-all definitions of care

## Repo structure
- `docs/` — core RFC-like documents (principles, MVP, roadmap)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — proposal, bug, and question templates

## How to contribute
Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`, then open an Issue using the appropriate template. Proposals should be concise and grounded in principles, not outcomes.

## License
TBD. No license has been selected yet.
