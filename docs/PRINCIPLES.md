# AHP Principles (Living RFC)

Each principle is expressed in RFC style with intent, MUST, MUST NOT, and brief notes.

## Presence First
**Intent**: Prioritize real-time safety and relational presence over metrics or backlog.

**MUST**
- Treat presence as a first-class system state.

**MUST NOT**
- Trade present safety for future optimization.

**Notes**: Presence includes attention, containment, and the ability to pause.

## Memory as a Right
**Intent**: Preserve a person’s history as theirs, not as a system asset.

**MUST**
- Allow the person to access, correct, and carry their memory.

**MUST NOT**
- Use memory to punish, score, or coerce.

**Notes**: Memory is portable, user-legible by default, and preserves traces of irreversible transitions.

## Slow Time
**Intent**: Ensure decisions can be delayed without penalty when safety requires it.

**MUST**
- Provide a safe pause state for reflection and recovery.

**MUST NOT**
- Force urgency as a default condition.

**Notes**: Slow time is a safeguard, not a bottleneck.

## Error as Event
**Intent**: Treat errors as bounded events, not character judgments.

**MUST**
- Record errors as contextual events with time and scope.

**MUST NOT**
- Convert errors into permanent labels.

**Notes**: Errors inform repair, not reputation.

## Guardian Asymmetry
**Intent**: Give the guardian more responsibility than power.

**MUST**
- Ensure guardianship increases duty of care and auditability.

**MUST NOT**
- Allow guardians to override identity or memory unilaterally.

**Notes**: Asymmetry prevents control by default.

## No Applause
**Intent**: Remove performative incentives that distort care.

**MUST**
- Keep recognition optional and non-competitive.

**MUST NOT**
- Use social rewards to force compliance.

**Notes**: Care is not a stage.

## Sovereign Exit/Return
**Intent**: The person may leave and return without penalty or shame.

**MUST**
- Provide a clear exit and a clear path back.

**MUST NOT**
- Gate return on punishment, confession, or forced re-entry.

**Notes**: Sovereignty requires continuity and dignity.
