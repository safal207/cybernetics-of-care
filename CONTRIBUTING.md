# Contributing

Thank you for helping shape a care-centered protocol. Contributions should be calm, precise, and grounded in principles.

## Proposing ideas (Issues)
Open an Issue using the proposal template. Keep scope small and align with AHP principles.

## Proposal format
Use the following structure:

- **Problem**: What harm, confusion, or gap exists?
- **Principle violated**: Which AHP principle is at risk?
- **Proposal**: A minimal change or addition.
- **Tradeoffs**: What do we lose or delay?

## Style
- No marketing language.
- No performance race or competitive framing.
- Prefer clarity over novelty.

## Communication rule
**No coercion, no punishment.**
Disagreement is acceptable; pressure, shaming, or retaliation is not. Keep feedback specific and reparable.
